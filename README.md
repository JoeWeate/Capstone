# Capstone
My Capstone project consists of designing a device to connect to the Internet of Things.  In connecting the IoT, we will explore options for security and vulnerabilities in the system.  
For my prospectus, I will explore the role of the IoT on future business models, and how this may change societys perception on privacy.  For my technical writing, I will explore different technical aspects of the security and various IoT structures.
